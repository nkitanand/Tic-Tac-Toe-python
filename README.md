# Tic-Tac-Toe-python
A tic-tac-toe bot written in python that plays optimally against you!

## Getting started
These instructions will let you play tic-tac-toe on your machine

### Prerequisites 
Python 2 should be installed in your machine 

### Instructions
Read instructions to play the game.

1. Start screen would look something like this 
```
-  -  -
-  -  -
-  -  -
```

2. Now think of these 9 dashes as old mobile phone keypad. Hence each dash can be represented by a digit like
```
<1>  <2>  <3>
<4>  <5>  <6>
<7>  <8>  <9>
```

3. Player position is represented by '1' and Bot by '0'. So if player choose to capture middle most block then he should input 5. The board will look something like this
```
-  -  -
-  1  -
-  -  -
```

4. Let's say Bot plays at 9, then the board will look something like this 
```
-  -  -
-  1  -
-  -  0
```

5. Good luck defeating the bot!
